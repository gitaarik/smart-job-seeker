I worked along-side the founder, made technical strategic decisions, and led the technical projects. I took great responsibility for scaling the platform to be able to handle thousands of orders per minute. I Optimized SQL queries and Python processes up to 60%, implemented comprehensive testing suites, and orchestrated CI/CD systems. I oversaw the creation of a React Native mobile app that contributed to a 40% revenue increase. I architected REST APIs and modernized frontend interfaces with React and Lit (Web Components), increasing user engagement by 30%. The platform has processed tens of millions in transactions and served hundreds of event organizers. I successfully led the technical growth from a startup to a competitive player on the Dutch ticketing market.

I'm using AI implementations (OpenAI, Gemini) to find the best matching jobs that meet my preferences. Various modules in the system help me with different tasks, like customizing my resume / CV, writing suitable cover letters, answering common application questions, and preparing for interviews. The system also gives an overview of your applications, where I can see and update the status and other details.\n\nAnother time I created my own fully customized desktop environment using awesome-wm and lua scripts. This DE is lightweight, simplistic, but feature-complete, and highly keyboard driven. It supports multiple desktops, multiple monitors, and it remembers and restores the location and position of windows across reboots. Because I can fully customize it and configure endless keyboard shortcuts, it allows me to work very efficiently. This setup ties in nicely with my tmux and Neovim workflows.

At Chipta I've build the Django backend from the ground up. I attached Django to an existing database, enabling a smooth transition from the previous system. I even modified Django to work with an existing translation system.\n\nI added React to the project for dynamic frontend pages, and used Django REST Framework to create APIs accommodating the React frontend. Many APIs were for admin pages so needed authentication and permission checks. I also implemented pagination, nested routing (using drf-nested-routers), filtering (using django-filter), field-based filtering (using drf-flex-fields), and custom APIs with custom urls.\n\nChipta is a ticketing system for event organizers. They can use the system to create a ticket shop and sell their tickets online. I've scaled the system to be able to handle thousands of ticket orders per minute. To optimize the SQL queries and Python processes, I used tools like Django Silk and Django Debug Toolbar.\n\nChipta has processed millions of euros in transactions. I developed the ticketshop, API and server processes that handle these transactions. I used payment provider SDKs to create the payments and forward users to the payment page.\n\nTo mail the tickets to users, I used Django's EmailMultiAlternatives class to send pretty HTML emails including inline images, not requiring loading external resources.\n\nTo create ticket PDFs, I used Django-WeasyPrint, which uses Weasyprint under the hood, and transforms a Django HTML template, including styles and images, to a PDF file.\n\nI used Python Fabric to build a comprehensive custom CI/CD pipeline to deploy the project to our servers.\n\nI used Selenium to write integration tests to automatically test our frontend.\n\nYou can sign up and create a ticketshop yourself at: https://chipta.com/	Python backend building experience	2	AuditOne

At Tender-it, I created a Django + Celery project that ran web crawlers that scraped tender data from various sources in various formats, then parsed that data into one format and saved it to the database. A A tender is a formal competitive bidding process for contracts, usually big government projects. The scripts would import thousands of tenders each day. Then I created a web platform with an Elasticsearch-based search engine to search, filter, sort and score these tenders.\n\nSome sources offered a REST API with JSON or structured data in some way. In those cases it was easy to get the data parse it. But many sources had out-of-date technology, and I needed to use unconventional methods to get the data, like website scraping, API reverse engineering, zip files with XML files over FTP, CSV files over email.\n\nSo I created a base class for importing the data and a base class for parsing the data. Then for each source I created a class, inheriting the base class and implementing the required methods. The base classes provided many helper methods for implementing common functionality. Like this I could easily add new sources.\n\nI imported all structured data into the MariaDB database. Then I created records in Elasticsearch with all the data that should be search-able, with a reference to the complete data in the database. In this way I could use Elasticsearch to efficiently find the desired record, and when found, fetch the complete info from the database.	Data management system experience	2	AuditOne

At Chipta, I led a project creating a ticket scanning app, to scan and validate event entrance tickets, using the phone camera. I decided on using React Native, and guided a medior developer to set up the project and make architectural decisions. I focused on providing the REST APIs and the related business logic.\n\nThe scan app would often be used by multiple people at the same time. So I had to make sure to keep the scan apps synchronized, so the same ticket could not be used multiple times. I used a websocket connection between the apps and the Django backend, using Django Channels. With an open websocket connection, I could instantly send data from the app to the backend and vice-versa, without any request overhead. This allowed me to create a custom protocol to send various types of data, like ticket scans, or undo-ing a scan, or even adding more valid tickets.\n\nWhen an app scanned a ticket, it send data about it to the backend over the websocket connection. Then the backend would broadcast this scan data to the other scan apps with open websocket connections, synchronizing the apps. Also, if an administrator would update the status of a visitor's ticket in the backend, it would also be broadcasted over the websockets.\n\nWe also created functionality for offline usage. The scan app would locally cache the tickets, and if the internet connection would be temporarily gone, still be able to scan tickets. After connection came back, it would restore synchronization and have custom conflict resolution in case of conflicts.\n\nThe scan app was successfully released on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, under the name "Chipta". Hundreds of event organizers have successfully used it to validate tickets from over a million of visitors at their events. The app was very important for Chipta's growth as it significantly reduced custom scanner hardware costs and management, and  contributed to a 40% revenue increase in the 2 years after the release.\n\nChipta in the Google Play Store:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chipta\n\nChipta in the Apple App Store:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/chipta/id1156524548	Full-stack app building experience	2	AuditOne
