Latest CV Review Your Current Score: 86/100 Generated on: 10/28/25 Benchmark

Against top-tier senior engineer resumes, Rik’s CV ranks strongly on impact
orientation, technical breadth, and leadership. It showcases a decade-plus track
record of shipping and scaling production systems in Python/Django and React,
with quantifiable results and clear ownership. To reach elite level, add a
sharper executive summary, standardize ATS-friendly titles/keywords, clarify
project metrics (e.g., star counts), and add an Education/Certifications section
alongside Languages and links. With these refinements, the profile will match
the polish of high-performing resumes used for global remote roles and tech lead
positions. Strengths

1 - Impact and outcome orientation

    Frequent quantified results (+40% revenue, +30% engagement, -80% deploy time, +80% test coverage).
    Strong scalability outcomes (thousands of orders/min, SQL optimization 30–60%).
    Demonstrates process improvements (TDD adoption, CI/CD orchestration).

2 - Technical breadth across the stack

    Backend depth in Python/Django/DRF with Celery, testing, and performance tuning.
    Modern frontend experience (React, React Native, TypeScript, Svelte, Web Components).
    Database versatility and performance (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Elasticsearch).
    DevOps exposure (Docker Compose, Ansible, GitHub Actions, AWS, Linode, Vercel).

3 - Leadership and team impact

    Led agile teams (3–5 devs) with measurable productivity improvement (+25%).
    Introduced code review rigor, TDD, and release cadence improvements.
    Built high-impact features (ticket scan app, subscription systems) that drive revenue and market entry.

4 - Open-source and thought leadership

    Multiple open-source projects with substantial traction (Git stars in the hundreds/thousands).
    Demonstrates community contribution and technical communication capability (Git Submodules Guide).

5 - Remote and startup fit

    5+ years remote experience; thrives in agile/startup contexts.
    Shipped end-to-end platforms for non-technical founders (consultative approach).

6 - Clear, concise bullet style

    Bullets consistently follow Action + Result pattern.
    Readable structure with strong verbs and metrics.

Areas for Improvement

1 - Content Gaps & Weaknesses

    No Education or Certifications section is present; many hiring systems expect it.
    Project star counts are listed as plain numbers (143, 108, 1022) without labels; unclear to non-technical readers and ATS.
    Some achievements could include scale/context (monthly active users, revenue bands, traffic volume, data sizes).
    Leadership scope could expand on responsibilities (hiring, mentoring, roadmapping, cross-functional alignment, stakeholder management).
    Security, reliability, and observability practices are mentioned broadly but could be evidenced (e.g., SLOs, incident reduction, SOC2/GDPR).
    Missing Languages section (valuable for international remote roles).

2 - Structure & Organization

    Contact and links are fragmented; provide explicit, labeled URLs (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio).
    Project entries lack consistent structure (title, link, role, stack, impact, traction).
    Consider a brief Tech Stack line under each role to improve scannability for recruiters.
    Normalize job titles to market standards (e.g., Lead Developer → Lead Software Engineer / Engineering Lead).
    Ensure consistent punctuation and tense (avoid first-person phrasing in projects).

3 - Language & Expression

    Remove subjective, generic claims in the summary (e.g., “Always current with industry trends”). Replace with concrete strengths and domains.
    Maintain third-person, impact-focused bullets (avoid “I used” in projects).
    Use consistent past tense for completed roles and present tense for current work.

4 - ATS & Recruiter Optimization

    Add standard keywords used by recruiters: microservices, asynchronous processing, message queues, caching, observability, IaC, OAuth/OIDC, JWT, API rate limiting, RBAC (only if applicable).
    Clarify employment types and locations uniformly; include Remote where relevant.
    Use standard job title variants in parentheses to match searches (Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Tech Lead).
    Label GitHub star counts and package downloads explicitly so ATS can parse the nouns.

5 - Visual & Design Elements

    Use consistent separators (commas or en dashes) and avoid decorative characters that may confuse ATS.
    Standardize bullet punctuation; end with periods or omit consistently.
    Make all links explicit and clickable (https://...).
    Ensure uniform date format across roles (MM/YYYY – MM/YYYY).

6 - Education & Certifications

    Add Education (degree or “Professional Development” if non-traditional).
    Include relevant recent certifications or notable coursework (e.g., AWS, security, data engineering).
    If no degree, include selected courses with institutions and dates to satisfy ATS filters.

Actionable Recommendations

    Professional Summary / Profile Statement

        Reframe the summary to a crisp, impact- and scope-led value proposition with core stacks, scale, leadership, and domains.

        Example:
            Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Engineering Lead with 12+ years building and scaling high-traffic, data-heavy products in Python/Django, Node.js, and React. Led agile teams (3–5) to ship revenue-driving features, reduce deploy times by 80%, and raise test coverage to 80%+. Scaled systems to thousands of orders/min through SQL and application-level optimizations. DevOps-minded (Docker, CI/CD, Ansible, AWS, Vercel) with strong UX sensibilities. Open-source contributor (1k+ stars) and 5+ years remote. Looking to lead end-to-end product delivery for growth-stage teams.

        Option with domain flavor (e-commerce/ticketing, search, subscriptions) and security/observability.

        Example:
            Senior Full-Stack Engineer specializing in e-commerce/ticketing, search, and subscription platforms. 12+ years optimizing Python/Django backends, React frontends, and data pipelines at scale (thousands of orders/min). Implemented TDD (80%+ coverage), CI/CD (-80% deploy time), and observability to improve reliability. Led teams of 3–5 engineers, mentored peers, and partnered with founders. Open-source author with widely adopted projects. Remote-first, security-aware (OWASP, GDPR).

    Experience Section

    Recommendations:
        For each role, add a one-line scope statement (team size, ownership, stack, domain).
        Add a Tech Stack line (e.g., Python, Django, DRF, Postgres, Redis, Celery, React, AWS, Docker, Ansible).
        Keep bullets outcome-first: Action + Result + Metric + Scope (when applicable).
        Label scale explicitly (e.g., 2M MAU, 50M requests/day, 2TB dataset, 100K daily scans) where possible.
        Normalize titles to match recruiter searches (Lead Software Engineer / Engineering Lead).
        Group similar achievements to avoid repetition (e.g., performance/scalability, DevOps, product outcomes).
        Convert project numbers to labeled metrics (GitHub Stars, NPM Downloads, PyPI Downloads).
        Remove first-person phrasing in projects; keep consistent tense and punctuation.

    Skill Section
        Group skills by Backend, Frontend, Datastores, DevOps/Cloud, Testing/Quality, Architecture/Patterns, Security/Compliance, Product/Process.
        Add missing or clarifying keywords if applicable: Redis (often used with Celery), Nginx, Gunicorn/Uvicorn, AsyncIO, OAuth2/OIDC, JWT, RBAC, GraphQL or gRPC (if relevant), API rate limiting/caching, Message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka), Feature flags, Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry), Sentry, Terraform/IaC, Kubernetes (only if used), Secrets management (Vault/SOPS).
        Under Cloud, break down AWS services actually used (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS, CloudFront, IAM) to increase keyword matches.
        Add Collaboration/Leadership tools if relevant (Jira, Confluence, Notion) and Agile (Scrum/Kanban).
        For UX, add accessibility (a11y), responsive design, and design systems if applicable.

    ATS & Recruiter Optimization
        Add standard title variants to headers: Senior Full-Stack Engineer (Lead Developer / Engineering Lead).
        Include synonyms and related keywords: microservices, asynchronous tasks, message queue (Celery/Redis/RabbitMQ), caching, rate limiting, CI/CD, IaC, observability, SLOs, incident response, security hardening, GDPR/PII, access control (RBAC).
        Replace bare numbers in Projects with explicit labels: GitHub Stars: 143; PyPI Downloads: X; NPM Downloads: Y.
        Ensure all links are explicit with protocol (https://) and labeled (GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio).
        Avoid special characters and multi-column layouts that some ATS fail to parse; use clean bullets and simple section headers.
        Normalize location and work arrangement (Remote, Hybrid) to aid recruiter filters.

    Formatting & Layout
        Condense contact block into a single, labeled line with URLs: Email | Phone | Location (CET) | Portfolio | GitHub | LinkedIn.

        Add “Public Speaking / Publications” if any meetups, blogs, or talks exist (link to slides/posts).
        Add “References available upon request” only if space permits; not required but acceptable internationally.
        Consider a short “Domains” line in Summary: ticketing/e-commerce, search/relevance, subscriptions/payments.

Final Summary

Rik, your CV is already strong: impact-rich, technically broad, and
leadership-forward. It clearly shows you can scale systems, lead small teams,
and deliver product outcomes. To reach an exceptional, recruiter-ready level,
tighten the summary into a value proposition, standardize titles/keywords for
ATS, clarify and label your project traction metrics, and add
Education/Certifications and Languages. Introduce a scope line and Tech Stack
per role, and keep bullets outcome-first with labeled scale. These refinements
will align your profile with elite senior/lead resumes used in global remote
hiring.

Next Steps:

    Rewrite the Professional Summary using one of the provided options (value proposition, domains, leadership scope).
    Normalize titles and add a Tech Stack line and one-line scope for each role, then refine bullets with Action + Result + Metric.
    Clean and consolidate contact/links with explicit labels and URLs (add LinkedIn URL).
    Reformat Projects with labeled metrics (GitHub Stars/NPM/PyPI) and add concise impact lines.
    Add Education/Certifications (or Professional Development) and a Languages section.
    Standardize formatting: dates, punctuation, and ATS-friendly characters; ensure all links are clickable.

If you implement these updates, your potential score could rise to ~92–95/100,
and you could see a 20–35% improvement in interview conversions for senior
full-stack and engineering lead roles, depending on role-market fit and tailored
applications.
