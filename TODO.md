  - Instead of "Python • Django • React • Node.js"
  - Something like:
    - "Python • Node.js • CI/CD • DevOps"
    - "Python & Node.js ecosystems"
- Fix references quotes layout on mobile site view
- Add common questions to info:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU6cEll_ls
- Add "Projects" section
- Enhance portfolio, inspiration: https://youtu.be/Y2kGqbzvAn4
- Generate static version of site so maybe reader view in firefox works

Done:
- Make theme switcher so that it doesn't go from auto to light if it's already
  on light, so goes to dark first
