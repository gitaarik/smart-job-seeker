    - Introduced Zulip for async collaboration
    - Directed Gitlab Merge Request flow
    - Directed Git flow & commit message conventions
    - Managed issue ticket system
    - Managed error logging system
  - Add to chipta projects.
  - Use for answer to "Tell me about a time when you had to lead a difficult
    project or manage a challenging team situation.
  - Prompt:
    - @src/lib/data/resume.ts interview question with the "React Native App with
    Struggling Developer" answer should be moved to the question "Tell me about
    a project that didn't go as planned and how you handled it.". And the
    question "Tell me about a time when you had to lead a difficult project or
    manage a challenging team situation." where you moved it away from should
    get a new answer that tells that in the beginning at Chipta we didn't have
    much structure and I progressively introduced team management methodologies.
    And this was challenging because I had to get everybody on the same page,
    and to learn these methodologies and associated tools. But I
    succeeded to progressively introduce it and we were more efficient and
    productive because of that. Some of the things I introduced:

    - Implementing scrum / agile methodologoies
    - Introduced Zulip for async collaboration
    - Directed Gitlab Merge Request flow
    - Directed Git flow & commit message conventions
    - Managed issue ticket system
    - Managed error logging system
- Add something highlighting that I've written extensive documentation

- Finish interview questions with STAR method
    - https://resources.biginterview.com/behavioral-interviews/star-interview-method/
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU6cEll_ls
- Add common questions to info:
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OU6cEll_ls

- Make variations of tech stack for various purposes:
  Shorter version:
    - Python | Django | Django REST Framework | REST APIs
    - JavaScript | Node.js | React
    - SQL & NoSQL
    - Git | Docker (Compose) | CI/CD | Ansible | GitHub Actions
    - Vercel | Linode | AWS

- Add "Projects" section
- Enhance portfolio, inspiration: https://youtu.be/Y2kGqbzvAn4
- Generate static version of site so maybe reader view in firefox works

## Done:

- Fix references quotes layout on mobile site view
- Change slogan
  - Instead of "Python • Django • React • Node.js"
  - Something like:
    - "Python • Node.js • CI/CD • DevOps"
    - "Python & Node.js ecosystems"
- Make theme switcher so that it doesn't go from auto to light if it's already
  on light, so goes to dark first
