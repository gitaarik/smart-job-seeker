- Add "Projects" section
- Change slogan
  - Instead of "Python • Django • React • Node.js"
  - Something like:
    - "Python • Node.js • Web • DevOps"
    - "Python & Node.js ecosystems"
- Make theme switcher so that it doesn't go from auto to light if it's already
  on light, so goes to dark first
- Enhance portfolio, inspiration: https://youtu.be/Y2kGqbzvAn4
- Generate static version of site so maybe reader view in firefox works
